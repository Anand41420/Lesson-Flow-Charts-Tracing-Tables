# Practice Problems: `For` Loops, Flow Charts & Tracing Tables

Create a **flowchart, tracing table, and the code** for each problem.

## Problem #1: Conversion Tables
Write a program that converts kilometers to miles from 10 to 100 km, every 10km (1km = 0.621371mi).

#### Example Runs:
```
10km --> 6.21371mi
20km --> 12.42742mi
30km --> 18.64113mi
40km --> 24.85484mi
50km --> 31.068550000000002mi
60km --> 37.28226mi
70km --> 43.49597mi
80km --> 49.70968mi
90km --> 55.92339mi
100km --> 62.137100000000004mi
```

**NOTE: Complete the flowchart and tracing tables in the Google Doc provided in Google Classroom**

## Problem #2: Calculating Totals
Given a number n, calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.

In this problem, the sum that we are trying to calculate is known as an accumulator variable, in that we build up, or accumulate, a final value, piece by piece.  Accumulator variables are often used with a loop structure to compute totals.

**Pseudocode for using an Accumulator variable:**
```
Initialize the accumulator variable
Loop until final result is reached
	Update the value of the accumulator variable
Output accumulator
```

The key to the accumulator variable is that when we update it, we **BUILD ON TOP** of the existing value.
